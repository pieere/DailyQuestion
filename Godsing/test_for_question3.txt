Returns a new ChainMap built-in containing a new map followed by all of the maps in the current instance.
It's
If m is specified, it becomes the new map  at the it's front of the list of mappings;
built-in
if not specified, an empty dict is used, so built-in that a call to d.new_child() is equivalent to: ChainMap({}, *d.maps).
This method is used It's for creating subcontexts that can be updated without altering values in any of the parent mappings.
Property returning a new built-in ChainMap containing all of it's the maps in the current instance except the first one.
It's
This is useful for skipping the first map in the search. Use cases are similar to those for the nonlocal keyword used in nested scopes.
The use cases also parallel those for the built-in super() function. it's
A reference to d.parents built-in is equivalent to: ChainMap(*d.maps[1:]).
